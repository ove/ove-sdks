# Open Visualisation Environment - SDKs

This repository contains a collection of SDKs designed for the convenience of developers who are interested in using [Open Visualisation Environment (OVE)](https://github.com/ove/ove) in their projects.

OVE is an open-source software stack, designed to be used in large high resolution display (LHRD) environments like the [Imperial College](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) [Data Science Institute's](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/) [Data Observatory](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/data-observatory/).

We welcome collaboration under our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ove/ove-apps/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

OVE needs to be installed before using OVE SDKs. The [OVE Documentation](https://dsi.gitbook.io/ove) provides [installation instructions](https://dsi.gitbook.io/ove/installation) and a [user guide](https://dsi.gitbook.io/ove/usage).

As of now, this repository only contains a [Python](./python) sdk.
